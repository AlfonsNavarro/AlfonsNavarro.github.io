This book tries to summarize with laboratory protocols, bioinformatic pipelines and review chapters, the main steps performed from translational researchers that from a patient tumor tissue or tumor cells, decides to identify and study tumorigenic lncRNAs. Beginning with the identification (profiling phase) and validation of candidate biomarkers, followed by the decoding of the function developed in the tumor.
